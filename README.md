This project considers the solid waste management system (SWMS) in Dinajpur municipal area, Dinajpur, Bangladesh, in order to develop a framework for sustainable solid waste management 
in future. In order to control kind of uncertainty situations which can occur by some random wedding ceremonies or by different occasions I have developed this web based project through
 which an user can send request to the waste management authority to respond an uncertain situation occur in an particular area. This web based project is developed using PHP, HTML, CSS
languages and SQL queries.
